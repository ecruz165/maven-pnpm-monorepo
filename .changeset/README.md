# Changesets

This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## What is a Changeset?

A changeset is a record of changes made to one or more packages in this monorepo. When you make changes to a package, you create a changeset file that describes:
- Which packages changed
- What type of version bump is needed (major, minor, or patch)
- A summary of the changes

## Workflow for Developers

### 1. Make Your Changes

Make your code changes to one or more packages (demo-module-a, demo-module-b, demo-module-c).

### 2. Create a Changeset

After making your changes, create a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will:
- Ask which packages changed
- Ask what type of version bump is needed (major, minor, patch)
- Ask for a summary of the changes
- Create a new changeset file in `.changeset/`

**Note:** Once the `scripts` package is created, it will be added to the ignore list in `.changeset/config.json`.

### 3. Commit the Changeset

Commit both your code changes AND the changeset file:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes + changeset"
```

### 4. Version Bump (Maintainers Only)

When ready to release, maintainers will run:

```bash
pnpm changeset:version
```

This will:
- Update package.json versions based on changesets
- Update CHANGELOG.md files
- Remove consumed changeset files

### 5. Publish (Maintainers Only)

After versioning, maintainers can publish to CodeArtifact:

```bash
pnpm release
```

## Semver Guidelines

- **Major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)**: New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

## Configuration

The changeset configuration is in `.changeset/config.json`:
- **baseBranch**: main
- **access**: restricted (for private packages)
- **ignore**: [] - Add package names here to exclude from versioning (e.g., "scripts" once created)
- **updateInternalDependencies**: patch - Internal deps get patch bumps
